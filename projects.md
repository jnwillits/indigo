<h2>Project Example 1: Custom Calculator</h2>

<p>I helped a truck rental business by providing a utility program to calculate credit due when trucks are returned with added fuel. The rental software they use calculates the amount to charge when fuel level is lower on return. However, it was necessary to manually determine credit when trucks were returned with added fuel. Truck types have varying fuel capacities, so the process was prone to error. The utility saves labor as well.</p>

<p>The user can set up multiple types of trucks by entering the vehicle name and tank capacity. The amount to credit per gallon must also be entered for setup. The data is automatically stored so day-to-day use of the program only requires selection of the truck type with a drop-down box and outgoing/incoming fuel levels with sliders that represent the fuel gauge.</p>

<h2>Project Example 2: Excel File Processing</h2>

<p>I am associated with a business that makes daily updates to an Excel spreadsheet to track a process that involves a series of dated events. The updates start by entering information from an Excel formatted report of past due balances that is exported from operational software. Obsolete data needs to be deleted from their custom spreadsheet, dates needs to be compared and updated, and new accounts are added.</p>

<p>I designed a labor-saving desktop utility that automates all of this. It automatically reads data from cells in the operational spreadsheet and makes date comparisons. It then updates and saves a new version of the custom spreadsheet. A date and time stamped backup of their file is also saved before the revisions are recorded.</p>
