<p>I write software that automates data management tasks, reducing errors and saving labor for businesses. For example, you may need to compile an end-of-day report using data in multiple spreadsheets. I can give you a custom utility that automatically reads the files, processes the data as necessary, and emails reports to your team members in Excel or PDF format.</p>

<p>If your business routinely uses Excel for data processing and reporting, there are most likely some great opportunities to save labor and improve consistency. For more about this, here is a good presentation by Chris Moffitt:</p>

<p>My deliverables include the source code in addition to Windows executible files. After our projects are completed, you can contract with me again via UpWork to make updates and further customizations. Otherwise, I can provide consultation as necessary to help your team members update the code.</p>

<p>My utilities can have an easy GUI interface and they are delivered to you as an executable file. I am available for freelance projects via <a href="https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~01191506b35232ebc4/?s=1110580753069494272">UpWork</a>.</p>
