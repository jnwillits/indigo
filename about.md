<p>I write software that automates data management tasks to reduce errors and save labor. For example, you may need to compile an end-of-day report using data in multiple spreadsheets. I can give you a custom utility that automatically reads the files, processes the data, and emails reports to your team members in Excel or PDF format.</p>

<p>If your business routinely uses Excel for data processing and reporting, there are probably great opportunities to save labor and improve consistency. For more about this, here is a good presentation by Chris Moffitt: <a href="https://github.com/chris1610/pbpython/blob/master/presentations/Escaping-Excel-Hell-with-Python-and-Pandas.pdf">Escaping Excel Hell...</a>  </p>

<p>My deliverables include the source code in addition to Windows executible files. After our projects are completed, you can contract with me to make updates and further customizations. Otherwise, I can provide consultation as necessary to help your team members update the code.</p>

<p>Projects I deliver can have an easy GUI interface and are delivered to you as executable files. I am available for freelance projects via <a href="https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~01191506b35232ebc4/?s=1110580753069494272">UpWork</a>.</p>
