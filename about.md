<p>I write software that automates data management tasks, reducing errors and saving labor for businesses. For example, you may need to compile an end-of-day report using data deposited in multiple spreadsheets. I can give you a custom utility that automatically reads the files, processes the data as necessary, and emails reports to your team members in Excel or PDF format.</p>

<p>My utilities have an easy GUI interface and they are delivered to you as an executable file. You can hire me for freelance work via my UpWork profile:</p>

</ul>

<p>If your business routinely uses Excel for data processing processing and reporting, there are most likely some great opportunities to save labor and improve consistency.</p>
